# How to help:

Interested developers can help by running the software and using the applications to test the functionality. They can file bug
issues in case something is not working. Bug issues should include a description of the bug, steps to reproduce and should 
have [Mainnet] in the title so they can be filtered more easily. We will fix bugs as soon as possible. 

As soon as the documentation is released, we will provide guides on how to help the development of Skywire, whether it is a
new transport implementation or an application developed on Skywire. Bounties will be available for completion of certain
tasks.
